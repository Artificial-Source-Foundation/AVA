# AVA Contributing

For the complete CMake option reference, see [build-configuration.md](../operations/build-configuration.md). Documentation changes follow [documentation.md](documentation-policy.md), including the offline source-link gate.

For the community entry point and project policies, see the root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). Please read the [`Code of Conduct`](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [`Governance`](../../GOVERNANCE.md), [`Security`](../../SECURITY.md), and [`Support`](../../SUPPORT.md) guidance before participating. Use private security reporting for suspected vulnerabilities; do not open public issues with exploit details or secrets.

## Prerequisites

- CMake 3.27 or newer; current CTests use timeout signal/grace properties introduced in 3.27.
- A C++23 compiler. GCC 13 is the tested Ubuntu 24.04 x64 compiler; other compilers are best-effort until the matrix below passes.
- `ctest` from CMake and Python 3 for the complete registered test, documentation, install, and package gates.
- Boost development headers and CMake package (`boost-devel` on Fedora).
- Wide-character ncurses development headers/library (`ncurses-devel` on Fedora).
- A writable `GITACHE_ROOT` before configuring the canonical non-Release presets.
- JSON-capable Universal Ctags when debug/libcwd print-member generation is enabled.
- `clang-format` version 22 or newer.
- `clang-tidy` when touching core logic or safety-sensitive paths.
- Optional `sccache` or `ccache` for faster repeated compilation.
- Internet access to `github.com` is required during configuration when pinned sources are not already present.

## Cloning the repository

```sh
git clone --branch develop --single-branch --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Artificial-Source/AVA.git
cd AVA
```

A recursive clone is ready for the CMake quick start below. For an older nonrecursive clone, run `git submodule update --init --checkout --recursive`. `./autogen.sh` is optional maintainer convenience: it initializes missing submodules at AVA's pinned commits, sets `push.recurseSubmodules` when missing, and prints build guidance. It does not configure or build AVA and is not required after the recursive clone command.

The canonical `dev`, `sanitize`, and `tsan` presets enable debug instrumentation. Before configuring them, set `GITACHE_ROOT` to an existing writable directory where Gitache packages can be compiled. The current requirement is approximately 50 MB. For example:

```sh
export GITACHE_ROOT="${GITACHE_ROOT:-$HOME/.cache/ava/gitache}"
mkdir -p "$GITACHE_ROOT"
```

When libcwd/debug print-member generation is enabled, configuration also requires Universal Ctags with JSON output support; Exuberant Ctags is insufficient. Python 3 is required for the complete debug-enabled test registration.

## Quick Start (build and test)

After preparing `GITACHE_ROOT` above, use the canonical developer preset:

```sh
cmake --preset dev
scripts/build.sh
scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Canonical sanitizer pass:

```sh
cmake --preset sanitize
scripts/build.sh --build-dir build-sanitize --jobs 2
scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build-sanitize --jobs 2
```

A direct configure is noncanonical unless it is cache-equivalent to the preset. The equivalent fallback commands are:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DEnableAvaBuildTests=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BetaTest \
  -DEnableDebug=ON \
  -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON

cmake -S . -B build-sanitize \
  -DEnableAvaBuildTests=ON \
  -DEnableAvaSanitizers=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BetaTest \
  -DEnableDebug=ON \
  -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
```

Use the repository build/test wrappers after either direct configuration. Do not describe a Release-default direct configure as equivalent to `dev` or `sanitize`.

The repository build and test runners detect the available logical cores and pass an explicit positive parallel level to CMake/CTest. Use `--jobs N`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=N`, or `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=N` to cap it; build options such as `--target` and CTest options such as `-R` are forwarded. The runners share one build-tree lock because concurrent builds/tests and several fixed integration-test roots are unsafe. Sanitizer examples use two jobs to limit memory pressure.

Parallel jobs speed clean builds; a compiler cache speeds repeated builds. To enable an installed cache, configure once with `cmake --preset dev -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` (or replace `sccache` with `ccache`). Use the same option with the sanitizer preset if desired; compiler flags keep those cache entries separate.

Tests currently build into `tests/ava_tests`, registered as focused `ava_tests.<suite>` CTests from sources under `tests/`. LSP coverage uses the `ava_fake_lsp_server` support executable.

## macOS port verification

The `macos/apple-silicon-support` development checkout was rebuilt on macOS 15.7.4 arm64 with Apple Clang 17 on 2026-09-05. This local checkout evidence does not qualify a clean release artifact or change the dated publication matrix below.

Run the offline terminal scenarios explicitly; the default suite skips them. These checks use isolated state, fake providers, tmux, and pseudo-terminals. The clangd check uses the locally installed language server:

```sh
AVA_TUI_TMUX_SMOKE=1 \
AVA_TUI_TERMINAL_LIFECYCLE_SMOKE=1 \
AVA_TUI_OSC8_SMOKE=1 \
AVA_TUI_KITTY_IMAGE_SMOKE=1 \
AVA_TUI_ITERM2_IMAGE_SMOKE=1 \
AVA_LSP_REAL_CLANGD_SMOKE=1 \
scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build --jobs 2
```

Native clipboard checks use a private pasteboard and leave the user clipboard untouched: `scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build -R native_clipboard`. Build a relocatable Mac archive with `python3 scripts/package-macos.py --build-dir build`; it includes ncurses and terminfo, strips Homebrew loader paths, and ad-hoc signs the bundled Mach-O files. `scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build -R package_macos` verifies the archive after relocation, including a fake-provider terminal and clipboard smoke. These local artifacts are not notarized or release-qualified.

The Mac port targets Apple Silicon (arm64). Intel and Rosetta qualification are outside its current scope.

The platform security difference is deliberate. Linux prepares Landlock/seccomp containment when supported by the kernel. The native macOS backend always reports containment unavailable and elevates containment-required commands to one-time CriticalAsk approval. These commands cannot acquire session grants or persistent Allow rules. Approval preserves executable sealing, owner/mode checks, descriptor/path identity validation, pre-exec pathname revalidation, inherited-FD cleanup, synthetic HOME/XDG/TMP values, and process-group cleanup. macOS does not claim Linux-equivalent isolation.

macOS rejects detected executable/path changes before execution. Its final pathname revalidation and `execve` are not atomic, so a residual pathname-swap window remains. This is another documented difference from Linux descriptor execution; the existing revalidation remains mandatory.

`ava_tests.macos_command_security` is a required, non-skipped Mac regression suite for that contract: unavailable containment, CriticalAsk metadata, repeated approval, denial without execution, normal approved execution, executable replacement rejection, and inherited-FD cleanup. Run it with the adjacent `tools`, `command`, `permission_rules`, and `tui_composer` suites before the final full run. The existing tools suite additionally covers executable/interpreter descriptor binding, pre-exec permission revocation, sanitized environment inheritance, cancellation, deadlines, and process-group cleanup.

Use `--build-dir build-sanitize` for ASan/UBSan after rebuilding that tree. With the terminal and clangd flags above enabled, the explicitly expected Mac skips are the opt-in live-provider suite and the Linux kernel-containment suite; the Mac security-contract suite must pass. Missing Linux-equivalent isolation is a documented limitation, not a blocker for this native port. Protocol-level graphics tests do not qualify every terminal emulator's visual rendering.

## Tested build matrix

| Combination | Status | 2026-08-23 evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 24.04.4 x64, GCC 13.3, Unix Makefiles, `BetaTest`, debug enabled | Tested | Configure, build, and full CTest passed |
| Ubuntu 24.04.4 x64, GCC 13.3, Ninja, `Release`, debug disabled | Tested additional build | Configure, build, full CTest, and version check passed |
| Clang 18 on the audit host | Best-effort; environment-blocked | Scanner/default GCC 16 interaction and Clang/libstdc++ C++23 `std::expected` combinations did not produce a qualifying build |
| MSVC, Windows, macOS | Unsupported | No native clean build/test evidence |
| AArch64 | Not qualified for the first publication | No native exact-candidate evidence in the frozen audit |
| Multi-config generators | Not release-qualified | Configuration/output/package selection is not proven configuration-safe |

Only Linux x64 is targeted for the first official publication, and dirty working trees are always unqualified. The audited x64 artifact requires BMI2, `GLIBC_2.38`, `GLIBCXX_3.4.32`, `CXXABI_1.3.13`, `libncursesw.so.6`, `libtinfo.so.6`, and `curl`; publication still requires minimum-host smoke of the exact retained bytes. See [build configuration](../operations/build-configuration.md) and the [release-readiness ledger](../product/release-readiness.md).

## Configuration

Lets assume that, next to `GITACHE_ROOT` (see above), the following environment variables are set:
* `REPOROOT` : full path of the repository root of ava (i.e. the directory that you cloned ava into.
* `BUILDDIR` : full path to the build directory; this can be inside or outside the repository root (e.g. `$REPOROOT/build` is fine) but should be an empty or non-existent directory.
* `CMAKE_CONFIG` : the CMake build type. Accepted values are `Release`, `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `BetaTest`, `RelWithDebug`, `Perf`, `Tracy`, and `None`, as enforced by `cmake/aicxx/cmake/CW_OPTIONS.cmake`.

Then one can configure AVA with:

```sh
cmake -S "$REPOROOT" -B "$BUILDDIR" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="$CMAKE_CONFIG" [OPTIONS]
```

where **`OPTIONS`** is one or more of the following:

* `-GNinja` : use ninja instead of make (highly recommended)
* `--log-level=NOTICE` : reduce CMake output to notices, warnings and errors. Possible values are `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `STATUS` (default), `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
  As a developer you should use the default (STATUS) or more verbose, otherwise the CMake options are not shown.
* `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` (or `ccache`) : use an installed compiler cache to speed up recompilations; set `SCCACHE_DIR` or `CCACHE_DIR` when a non-default writable cache directory is needed.
* `-DAVA_BUILD_TESTS=ON` : to compile the testsuite of ava.
* `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` : generate the `compile_commands.json` compilation database, useful for tools that need the exact compiler command line for each source file.
  Typical tools that use it are:
  - `clangd`, used by editors and IDEs for C/C++ language-server features such as code completion, diagnostics, go-to-definition and include resolution.
  - `clang-tidy`, for static analysis and automated lint/fix checks.
  - other Clang-based tooling, including custom LibTooling tools, refactoring tools, include analyzers and source indexers.

Provided the `--log-level` is `STATUS` other options are printed, using colors, during configuration.
For example:
```
-- Option EnableDebug (Build for debugging) =
        ON (default)
```
If everything is green then you are using the defaults, which is usually the best.
If an option is printed in red then it was manually overridden and different from the default.
For example, using `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` will print
```
-- Option CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE =
        Debug
```
where `Debug` is in red, because the default is `Release`.

## Building

After (re)configuration AVA can be build by issuing the command:
```sh
scripts/build.sh --build-dir "$BUILDDIR" --jobs "$CPUS" --config "$CMAKE_CONFIG" [--verbose]
```

Adding `--verbose` shows the exact commands that are being executed by ninja;
mostly useful if one want to inspect if the expected compiler arguments are being passed to the compiler.

Note that the `--config "$CMAKE_CONFIG"` is only needed for multi-target generators, so not for `Makefile` or `Ninja`.
`CPUS` should be set to the number of processors that you want to use for compilation. For example, use `CPUS=$(nproc --all)`.

## Formatting And Static Checks

Format changed C++ with the repository `.clang-format`:

```sh
clang-format -i <changed-cpp-or-header-files>
```

Run clang-tidy against files you changed after configuring the build:

```sh
clang-tidy <changed-cpp-files> -p build
```

Verify that every `ASSERT` under `src/ava/` keeps its required immediately
preceding comment, both directly and through its two focused CTests:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify-assert-comments.py .
scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build \
  -R '^ava_tests\.assert_comments_(checker|source)$' \
  --output-on-failure
```

For Markdown changes, run both direct repository gates and their four focused
CTest cases:

```sh
python3 scripts/verify-markdown-links.py . --source-tree
python3 scripts/verify-documentation-structure.py .
scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build \
  -R '^ava_tests\.(markdown_(link_verifier|links_source)|documentation_structure_(checker|source))$' \
  --output-on-failure
```

When documentation paths or release-artifact payloads change, also run the
offline package, install, and provenance checks:

```sh
scripts/run-tests.sh --build-dir build \
  -R '^ava_release\.(provenance|install_component|package_linux)$' \
  --output-on-failure
```

Always finish with:

```sh
git --no-pager diff --check
```

## Review Expectations

- Keep changes small and subsystem-owned.
- Preserve backend permission boundaries for file writes and process execution.
- Add focused regression tests for safety-sensitive changes.
- For plugin or MCP contract changes, follow [`docs/plugin-compatibility-policy.md`](../plugin-compatibility-policy.md) and update deterministic golden fixtures when stable serialized shapes intentionally change.
- Do not include `build*/` trees or `docs/reference-code/` repositories in reviews.

## GitHub Actions dependencies

Third-party GitHub Actions must be pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA with an exact release-tag comment (for example `# v7.0.1`). Before bumping an action, verify the official tag-to-SHA mapping and the action's release/runner requirements, then update every `uses:` occurrence in the workflow. GitHub-hosted runners are the current CI baseline; Node 24-based action majors require Actions Runner `>= 2.327.1`. Never replace a pinned SHA with a mutable tag such as `@v7`. Dependabot opens weekly GitHub Actions update PRs against `develop`, but human review of the pin, comment, and runner fit remains required.
