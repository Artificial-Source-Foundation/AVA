# Backend Modernization Progress

This ledger is the source of truth for AVA's backend modernization. A task is marked
`completed` only when its acceptance evidence is present in the repository and the
recorded commands have passed.

## Project context

- Implementation branch: `backend-modernization`
- Starting commit: `c94ac8631419`
- Started: 2026-08-30
- Coordinator: principal implementation agent
- Historical working-tree note: the branch was created while unrelated primary-agent
  work was preserved separately. That feature later arrived through the prioritized
  upstream lineage and is now part of the integrated base rather than an M0/M1 commit.
- Prioritized upstream base: `origin/develop` at `3924ef03` was statically audited and
  made an ancestor of this branch on 2026-09-02; the 33 modernization commits were
  replayed above it. The original M0 hashes remain the evidence identity for the
  pre-upstream `c94ac8631419` cohort and are not reinterpreted as measurements of the
  rebased runtime.
- Dependency policy: upstream added the pinned MIT `memory` submodule at
  `4ddb41469f323e32c170637aa413a132e83727be`. Its source, license, build/runtime
  integration, and static security properties were reviewed; it is attributed in
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Submodule bootstrap was restored to exact-gitlink checkout
  and rejects mismatches rather than following mutable branches.

| M0.2 | Reproducible startup, RSS, dispatch, plugin, catalog, session, cancellation, cleanup, and memory harness | Performance Engineer | completed | `scripts/benchmark-backend.py`; `tests/backend_benchmark_helper.cpp`; `tests/backend_benchmark_test.py`; `tests/CMakeLists.txt`; `docs/development/backend-benchmarking.md` | Release and BetaTest `ava_benchmark.harness_self_test` + `ava_benchmark.smoke`; five-run baseline schema v2 | `8fab13fe`, `971327fb` | Machine-cold startup, persistent-worker warmth, selective routing, and indexed sessions remain explicitly unsupported before their owning milestones |
| M0.3 | Establish honest machine-recorded baseline and calibrated budgets | Performance Engineer + coordinator | completed | `docs/engineering/performance-baseline.md`; `docs/engineering/backend-performance-baseline-2026-08-30.json` | Release baseline, 5 runs, exact artifacts/hashes/source/build/host identity, raw RSS snapshots, median/p95/max | `6999441f` | Same-host 20% investigation trigger is non-gating; provenance is best-effort and cold-cache control unavailable |
| M0.4 | Add lightweight CI performance/reliability smoke | Performance Engineer + coordinator | completed | `tests/CMakeLists.txt`; harness smoke checks | Default CTest registration; Release and BetaTest smoke pass; helper omission has a negative test | `8fab13fe`, `971327fb` | Coarse catastrophic ceilings intentionally do not gate microbenchmark deltas |
| M1.1 | Define process ownership identifiers and supervisor API | Process Lifecycle Architect + coordinator | completed | [`docs/engineering/process-supervisor-adr.md`](process-supervisor-adr.md) | Accepted ADR; source Markdown links, documentation structure, and textual diff checks passed | `44f28d1a` | Implementation evidence remains in M1.2–M1.5 |

| M1.3 | Migrate every process-spawning subsystem | Process Lifecycle Engineer + subsystem owners | active | Curl transport and clipboard helpers; migration matrix in [`docs/engineering/process-supervisor-adr.md`](process-supervisor-adr.md#api-and-authority-contract) | Curl and clipboard now use explicit application/session Supervisor scopes, exact role environments, bounded output/deadlines, managed-group cleanup, and static no-legacy-authority contracts; focused/repeated/full/sanitizer tests and process smoke pass | `d33c1be5`, `a6e6465c`, `f135c476`, `ffda314f`, `93d991c7` | Plugin, MCP, LSP, Bash, Mermaid, browser opener, and external editor remain legacy-local; no mixed ownership or runtime fallback is permitted |
| M1.4 | Add bounded, secret-safe process diagnostics | Process Lifecycle Engineer | active | Process snapshots, launch framing, readiness, benchmark redaction | Closed content-free process reasons/snapshots and benchmark redaction are implemented and tested | M1 foundation commits | Application trace/support-export adaptation remains incomplete; no raw PID/PGID/fd/path/argv/environment content may be added |
| M1.5 | Add leak, cancellation, timeout, descendant, and shutdown tests | Process Test Engineer | active | Process, capability, Curl, clipboard, static-contract, and schema-v3 benchmark suites | Exact settlement/reap, leader-first descendants, refusal escalation, race gates, environment canaries, descriptor replacement/FD hygiene, deadline cleanup, pidfd/fallback, Curl, clipboard, repeated races, ASan/UBSan, TSan, and full 165-test BetaTest pass | M1 foundation and migration commits | Real PTY gates remain for editor migration; separate conservative-POSIX CI and future Windows tests remain required |

## Review finding ledger

The integrated M0 review used the default reviewer on the complete mapping, harness,
and baseline delta. M1 planning findings record accepted design gates; `fixed` means the
design blocker is resolved, not that implementation is complete. Findings keep stable
IDs and one of: `open`, `fixed`, `rejected`, or `deferred`.

| Finding | Milestone | Status | Evidence / resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0-R1 | M0 | fixed | Schema v2 smoke requires an executable helper, unsupported required seams fail checks, and negative harness tests cover omission/non-executable helpers. |
| M0-R2 | M0 | fixed | Benchmark children now receive a fixed minimal environment; tests prove provider/base-URL/database/loader/askpass/Kerberos/Docker/Python variables do not survive; docs explicitly deny OS network containment. |
| M0-R3 | M0 | fixed | `backend-current-state.md` now records that plugin/MCP normal shutdown reaps only the leader and can leave a same-group descendant. |
| M0-R4 | M0 | fixed | Schema v2 retains the complete memory-helper output and every RSS snapshot, aggregates per-run maxima, and measures Linux current RSS delta with peak details separate. |
| M0-R5 | M0 | fixed | Schema v2 records SHA-256/size/mode/mtime for all artifacts, source commit/tree/dirty state, CMake/compiler/feature metadata, and explicitly unverified provenance. |
| M0-R6 | M0 | fixed | Native registry timing now performs exact lookup of the final built-in and emits `ns_per_lookup`; catalog timing is labeled composite. |
| M0-R7 | M0 | fixed | M0 rows now identify final files, tests, benchmark evidence, commits, and calibrated residual risks. |
| M0-D1 | M0 | fixed | A full-suite-only `ESRCH` was traced to `/proc/<pid>/stat` disappearing between open and read in `parallel_test_runner_test.py`; the test now accepts only `ENOENT`/`ESRCH` as successful process disappearance. The focused test passed 100 consecutive runs and the full suite passed afterward. |
| M1-GATE-001 | M1 | fixed | [Foreground editor job control](process-supervisor-adr.md#m1-gate-001) is accepted: verified private group, RAII foreground-terminal transfer/restoration, bounded unsupported suspension, and real PTY gates. |
| M1-GATE-002 | M1 | fixed | [Environment and credential inheritance](process-supervisor-adr.md#m1-gate-002) is accepted: exact profiles, ambient proxy/CA only for curl, explicit MCP env authority, minimal plugin env, and positive/negative canary tests. |
| M1-GATE-003 | M1 | fixed | [Dependency enforcement](process-supervisor-adr.md#m1-gate-003) is accepted: `process` is scanned, may depend only on core, consumers may depend on it, and the exception fixture remains empty. |
| M1-CAP-001 | M1 | fixed | Opaque anchored executable/cwd capabilities, physical-parent external `AnchorOpen`, descriptor exec, final pre-fork freshness, and mandatory secure-adoption cwd landed inert in `eb3f2690`. The severe filesystem/exec security review found no material issue; deterministic replacement, script, policy, content-redaction, and descriptor-hygiene tests pass. |
| UPSTREAM-SEC-001 | Integration | fixed | Static audit found no embedded malware, binary payload, obfuscation, persistence, credential exfiltration, or unexplained network behavior in `c94ac8631419..3924ef03` or the exact aicxx/utils/memory pins. The mutable maintainer-bootstrap path found during that audit was removed; `.gitmodules` is checkout-only and `autogen.sh` initializes exact gitlinks and rejects `+`/`U` states. |
| UPSTREAM-SEC-002 | Integration | fixed | Project-primary provenance is typed, effective untrusted transitions are serialized across one manager/workspace, active runs/appends/jobs/deliveries block persistence, old controllers retire irreversibly, stale capsules are purged, and session construction/refresh holds a navigation reservation from before trust resolution through publication. Deterministic both-order races and the severe security re-review passed. Separate AVA processes/managers observe persisted trust only at their own open/reload boundary. |
| UPSTREAM-DEP-001 | Integration | fixed | The new pinned MIT `memory` source was reviewed as a compiled production dependency, attributed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and included in release provenance. Its application pool is currently constructed but unused; no performance improvement is claimed. |

## Prioritized upstream integration evidence

- Audited top-level range: `c94ac863141975806bbab52e950a2f2499108b65..3924ef03a81ae991f5116c9321b05bc7d2f016b4` (24 commits, 89 net-changed files).
- Audited dependency changes: aicxx `411eae31..15c31e10`, utils `5ed11a17..07c67a53`, and new memory pin `4ddb41469f323e32c170637aa413a132e83727be`. All commits were unsigned; unsigned status was recorded as provenance, not treated as evidence of malware.
- Integration shape: `3924ef03` is the exact ancestor of the replayed modernization chain. Range comparison found one manual conflict in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`; its union retains Carlo's process-gate/timing tests and the modernization benchmark/process registrations.
- Integrated BetaTest build passed after regenerating stale build-tree print-member output. Focused integration/security/process tests passed, four concurrency suites passed 20 repetitions, and the complete 164-test CTest run passed with only documented opt-in skips.
- Focused ASan/UBSan passed 9/9 for runtime authority and process/Curl/clipboard paths. Focused TSan passed 4/4 for the session controller, subagent coordinator/delivery manager, and runtime trust races.
- `ava_benchmark.smoke` and `ava_benchmark.process_smoke` passed. These are reliability checks, not latency or memory improvement claims; a fresh paired Release cohort is still required before making performance claims against the historical M0 source.

## Current M1 capability evidence

- `eb3f2690` adds move-only, native-handle-free executable/cwd capabilities and keeps them inert for production: Curl and clipboard remain path launches, while LSP/Bash/Mermaid consume nothing yet.
- Linux descriptor execution uses typed `execveat(AT_EMPTY_PATH)` framing; the conservative POSIX `fexecve` branch is compiled by contract but has not run on a separate POSIX host. Windows remains unsupported.
- `ava_tests.process_capability_posix` passed 20 consecutive runs; focused process/core/tool/containment and both benchmark smoke suites passed.
- The full BetaTest suite passed 165/165 with documented opt-in skips. Focused ASan/UBSan passed 4/4 and the TSan capability suite passed.

## M0 validation evidence

- `cmake --preset release` and the Release `ava`, benchmark-helper, and fake-provider
  targets built successfully.
- `cmake --preset dev` and the complete BetaTest build succeeded.
- Release and BetaTest `ava_benchmark.harness_self_test` and
  `ava_benchmark.smoke` passed.
- The schema-v2 baseline completed five runs for every currently measurable family;
  the committed JSON passed the harness schema/identity validator.
- `ctest --repeat until-fail:100 -R '^ava_build\.parallel_test_runner$'` passed
  after the procfs-disappearance race fix.
- The complete BetaTest CTest run passed all 147 registered tests with zero failures;
  credential/live-provider and opt-in terminal tests reported their expected skips.
- Source Markdown links, documentation structure, Python compilation, C++ formatting,
  and `git diff --check` passed.
- No production runtime source or production dependency changed in M0.
