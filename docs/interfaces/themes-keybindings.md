# Themes And Keybindings

This guide covers the user-editable TUI display and keyboard shortcut files.
For the wider configuration layout, see [CONFIG.md](../core/configuration.md) and
[USAGE.md](../core/usage.md).

AVA uses XDG paths on Linux. If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset or not absolute,
AVA falls back to `~/.config`.

| Setting | Path |
| --- | --- |
| AVA config directory | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava` or `~/.config/ava` |
| Display theme, image visibility, and image width | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava/display.json` |
| Custom theme files | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava/themes/*.json` |
| Keybinding overrides | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava/keybinds.json` |

## Theme selection

AVA has three built-in display modes:

| Theme | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dark` | Built-in dark ncurses palette. The ordinary screen canvas inherits the terminal background; contrast surfaces stay styled. This is the final fallback. |
| `light` | Built-in light ncurses palette. The ordinary screen canvas inherits the terminal background; contrast surfaces stay styled. |
| `plain` | No ANSI styling/color. Layout, modal text, and width behavior remain available. |

Persist the TUI theme with `/theme`:

```text
/theme                 # show configured and active theme
/theme dark
/theme light
/theme plain
/theme ocean           # custom theme named "ocean"
/theme reset           # clear the stored theme and return to automatic fallback
```

The theme is stored in the shared display document:

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "show_images": true,
  "image_width_cells": 60
}
```

`show_images` and `image_width_cells` are optional. When absent, AVA keeps the
historical defaults `true` and `60`. `/theme`, `/images`, and `/image-width` each
update or erase only their owned key and preserve every other field, including
unknown top-level members.

```text
/images                 # show configured and effective visibility
/images on|off|reset
/image-width            # show configured and effective width
/image-width <8..160>|reset
```

`image_width_cells` accepts integers only in the inclusive range 8–160. Booleans,
strings, floats, negatives, overflow, and out-of-range integers are rejected.
When images are disabled, AVA keeps textual attachment metadata, does not load
preview bytes, and emits no Kitty/iTerm2 graphics. When enabled, the configured
width is clamped again to the current content viewport while preserving aspect
ratio.

`/theme reset` removes only the theme key. If no other recognized or unknown
fields remain, the file becomes an empty object instead of being deleted:

```json
{
}
```

`/theme default` and `/theme auto` are accepted reset aliases. Built-in aliases
such as `ava-dark`, `ava-light`, `none`, `no-color`, and `no_color` are accepted
when AVA reads config, but the user-facing `/theme` form is `dark`, `light`,
`plain`, a custom theme name, or `reset`.

During an interactive TUI run, AVA watches `display.json` and the selected custom
theme file. Valid hand edits are applied automatically; invalid JSON, unsupported
theme names, malformed `show_images`/`image_width_cells`, duplicate custom theme
names, or invalid custom theme files are reported with path-specific diagnostics
while the previous active presentation remains in use. Use `/reload theme` when
you want an explicit retry or diagnostic. `/settings` opens a compact shallow root
(Theme, Display, Model, Input, Workspace, Tools). Empty search chrome stays hidden
until typing. Theme contains built-in/custom theme choices; Display contains image
visibility/width and thinking-block rows. Both call the same authoritative commands.
Highlighting a previewable Theme or Display row applies a presentation-only overlay
and never writes config; Enter confirms once through the application-owned writer.
Esc, selector replacement, error, or shutdown restores the latest authoritative
presentation. Mouse clicks in settings change selection/highlight only.

## Theme precedence and environment variables

The active theme is resolved in this order:

1. `NO_COLOR` with any non-empty value forces `plain` mode.
2. An active `/settings` Theme or Display highlight preview (presentation-only; cleared on
   confirm/cancel/replacement/shutdown) sits above process and file config.
3. `AVA_TUI_THEME=dark|light|plain` overrides persisted config for this process.
4. `display.json` selects a built-in theme or a valid custom theme.
5. Startup OSC 11 terminal-background detection selects `light` or `dark` when
   theme selection is still automatic.
6. `COLORFGBG` background inference selects `light` or `dark` when available.
7. Built-in `dark` is the fallback.

Examples:

```sh
AVA_TUI_THEME=light ava
AVA_TUI_THEME=plain ava
NO_COLOR=1 ava
COLORFGBG='15;0' ava
```

`AVA_TUI_THEME` only selects built-in themes. Use `display.json` or `/theme` for
custom themes. Explicit `dark`, `light`, `plain`, and custom selections always
win over detection. Unknown or `auto` `AVA_TUI_THEME` values are ignored rather
than written to config and keep the ordinary automatic fallback path.

When theme selection is still automatic at interactive TUI startup, AVA queries
the direct terminal background once with OSC 11 (`ESC ]11;? ESC \`) after the
curses session enters and before the first paint. A strict response parser accepts
only OSC 11 replies terminated by BEL or ST, bounded to 256 bytes, in the forms
`rgb:R/G/B`, `rgba:R/G/B/A` (alpha ignored when valid), `#RRGGBB`, and
`#RRRRGGGGBBBB` with equal 1-4 hex channel widths. Channels are scaled to 0..255
and classified with the existing integer luminance threshold of 180
(`(R*299 + G*587 + B*114) / 1000`). The settings panel marks the resulting theme
as current without exposing probe-source or raw-color diagnostics. Built-in
light/dark palettes keep the ordinary screen canvas at the terminal-default
background (`screen_bg = -1`).

The query is skipped under tmux (`TMUX` set or `TERM` starting with `tmux`); AVA
does not attempt tmux passthrough wrapping. Detection is session-scoped: it is
reset before each interactive TUI session and again on every exit, is not
re-probed on suspend/resume, and never flips the theme after first paint. Keys,
resizes, and complete bracketed pastes observed while waiting for the reply are
preserved in order for the composer; keyboard-protocol replies and OSC control
replies remain discard-only. The main probe drain budget is 50 ms; escape
assembly begun at that edge may still use its ordinary 50 ms budget, and a
bracketed paste already begun may finish under its ordinary 1 s cap so the paste
stays atomic.

`COLORFGBG` remains a lower-precedence hint when OSC 11 is unavailable. AVA reads
the final `;`- or `:`-separated numeric field as the terminal background color
index; light backgrounds select `light`, and darker backgrounds select `dark`.

## Custom `themes/*.json`

Custom themes are global user files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava/themes/*.json`.
AVA matches by the theme file's `name` field, not by the filename. Names must be
unique, non-empty, must not contain whitespace, `/`, or `\`, must not be `.` or
`..`, and must not conflict with a built-in/reset name.

Discovery and the 500 ms display watch are bounded and deterministic under app
ownership (not the renderer). Each candidate is opened once with
`O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW`, verified as a regular file via
`fstat`, and read under `min(64 KiB per file, remaining 256 KiB aggregate budget)`
with a 64-candidate cap. Symlinks and special files are skipped. Candidates are
ordered by normalized absolute path; listing/watch catalog keep the first valid
file per name as a bounded prefix. Configured or explicit named load fails closed
on duplicates and also when discovery is incomplete (candidate cap or aggregate
budget), even if one matching file appeared before the boundary—so a late
duplicate cannot be silently ignored. The display watch performs one discovery
pass and reuses it for both configured custom resolution and the catalog
fingerprint. Oversized/invalid/unreadable unconfigured files are omitted and
cannot break a configured built-in reload.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "ocean",
  "vars": {
    "primary": "#0066cc",
    "paper": 255
  },
  "colors": {
    "text": "",
    "muted": 242,
    "success": 34,
    "warning": "#ffaa00",
    "error": "#ff0000",
    "accent": "primary",
    "screenBg": "paper",
    "composerBg": 236,
    "toolBg": 235,
    "questionBg": 237
  }
}
```

`colors` must provide the eight required AVA roles below. It may also provide
`toolBg` and `questionBg`; each falls back to `composerBg` when omitted for
compatibility with existing custom themes.

| Role | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Main foreground text. |
| `muted` | Secondary text, metadata, and subtle borders. |
| `success` | Successful status. |
| `warning` | Warning status. |
| `error` | Error or denial status. |
| `accent` | Focus, selection, and brand accents. |
| `screenBg` | Main screen background. Built-in dark/light inherit the terminal default; custom themes may set an explicit color. |
| `composerBg` | Elevated palette/select-list panel background. Ordinary draft, status, and footer dock rows inherit terminal-default/`screenBg` like transcript chat; only palettes, selectors, and other elevated panels use `composerBg`. |
| `toolBg` | Optional low-contrast tool-card background. |
| `questionBg` | Optional distinct question dock/modal background. |

Each color value can be:

- `""` for the terminal default color.
- An integer from `0` through `255` for an xterm-256 color.
- A `"#RRGGBB"` hex color, approximated to the nearest xterm-256 color.
- A variable name from `vars`; variables can themselves be integers, hex strings,
  `""`, or other variables.

AVA's theme schema is intentionally small. A custom theme controls these eight
required ncurses color roles plus optional tool-card and question backgrounds; it does not change typography, glyphs, layout, spacing,
individual markdown/syntax tokens, every permission/tool-card state, or package
resource behavior. `NO_COLOR` and `plain` mode override custom color output.

## Pi parity gaps for themes

AVA supports Pi-compatible behavior where it fits the current product boundary,
but the theme system is not a full Pi clone.

| Pi capability | AVA status |
| --- | --- |
| Large 51-token theme schema | Not implemented. AVA accepts the eight required roles and optional surface backgrounds above. |
| Project-local themes | Not implemented. Themes are loaded only from the user's global XDG config directory. |
| Package-delivered themes and package theme filters | Deferred with package/resource management. AVA does not install or activate theme packages. |
| Remote package/theme marketplace | Deferred pending provenance, trust, compatibility, rollback, and update policy. |

## Keybinding overrides

AVA keybindings are semantic actions, not raw terminal escape rewrites. The
override file is a JSON object at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ava/keybinds.json`:

```json
{
  "tui.input.submit": "Enter",
  "tui.input.newLine": ["Shift+Enter", "Ctrl+Enter"],
  "app.message.followUp": "Alt+Enter",
  "tui.editor.cursorLineStart": ["Home", "Ctrl+A"],
  "tui.editor.deleteToLineStart": "Ctrl+U",
  "app.models.clearAll": "Ctrl+X",
  "tui.select.confirm": ["Enter", "Space"],
  "tui.select.cancel": ["Esc", "Ctrl+W"]
}
```

Values can be a single string, an array of strings, or a comma-separated string
for compatibility. Missing actions inherit built-in defaults.

Manage the file from inside the TUI:

```text
/keybindings                         # show effective bindings
/hotkeys                             # alias for the same view
/keybindings init [--force]          # create or explicitly replace a starter file
/keybindings import <path> [--force] # validate and install an existing JSON file
/keybindings set <action> <key>[,<key>...]
/keybindings reset <action>          # remove one override and inherit defaults again
/keybindings validate                # check keybinds.json without applying it
/reload keybindings                  # apply valid edits in the running TUI
```

`/keybindings import` resolves relative paths from the current runtime directory.
`init` and `import` refuse to replace an existing `keybinds.json` unless
`--force` is supplied. `set` and `reset` preserve the other valid object entries
while changing only the requested action.

## Action ids and aliases

The generated starter file uses namespaced Pi-style ids where AVA has matching
semantics, such as `tui.input.submit`, `tui.editor.cursorLeft`,
`tui.select.confirm`, `app.models.clearAll`, and `app.session.resume`.

AVA also accepts its snake_case action names and many legacy/camel aliases. For
example, these all resolve to the same action:

```json
{
  "tui.editor.cursorLineStart": "Home",
  "cursor_line_start": "Ctrl+A",
  "cursorLineStart": "Ctrl+A"
}
```

When the same action is listed more than once, the higher-precedence current id
wins; for equal-precedence ids, the later entry wins. Pi ids that do not have an
AVA equivalent are rejected with an action-specific error instead of being
silently ignored.

Common user-facing action groups:

| Group | Canonical ids and accepted alias style |
| --- | --- |
| Input submission | `tui.input.submit` (`submit`), `tui.input.newLine` (`new_line`, `newLine`), `app.message.followUp` (`message_follow_up`, `followUp`) |
| Composer editing | `tui.editor.cursorLeft/Right/Up/Down`, `cursor_left`/`cursorLeft`; `tui.editor.cursorLineStart/End`; `tui.editor.cursorWordLeft/Right`; `tui.editor.deleteCharBackward/Forward`; `tui.editor.deleteWordBackward/Forward`; `tui.editor.deleteToLineStart/End`; `tui.editor.undo`, `tui.editor.redo`, `tui.editor.yank`, `tui.editor.yankPop` |
| App controls | `app.clear` (`clear_input`, `clear`), `app.interrupt` (`interrupt`), `app.exit` (`exit`), `app.editor.external` (`external_editor`, `externalEditor`), `app.suspend` (`suspend`), `app.clipboard.pasteImage` (`clipboard_paste_image`, `pasteImage`) |
| Completion and palettes | `tui.input.tab` (`autocomplete_accept`), `history_prev`, `history_next`, `palette_prev`, `palette_next`, `mode_toggle` |
| Select-list modals | `tui.select.up/down/pageUp/pageDown/confirm/cancel`, plus aliases like `select_prev`, `selectPrev`, `select_confirm`, and `selectConfirm` |
| Transcript and tool details | `tui.editor.pageUp`, `tui.editor.pageDown`, `app.tools.expand` (`details_toggle`, `expandTools`), `jump_to_bottom` (default Ctrl+End), `message_prev` (default Alt+K), `message_next` (default Alt+J) |
| Models and thinking | `app.model.select`, `app.model.cycleForward`, `app.model.cycleBackward`, `app.thinking.cycle`, `app.thinking.toggle`, `app.overview.toggle` (unbound by default; toggles the path-free startup overview), `app.models.save`, `app.models.enableAll`, `app.models.clearAll`, `app.models.toggleProvider`, `app.models.reorderUp`, `app.models.reorderDown` |
| Sessions and trees | `app.session.new/tree/fork/resume/togglePath/toggleSort/toggleNamedFilter/rename/delete/deleteNoninvasive`, unbound-by-default `app.sessions.summarizeParent` for an eligible direct abandoned parent, `app.tree.foldOrUp/unfoldOrDown/editLabel/toggleLabelTimestamp/filter.labeledOnly/filter.all` |

Run `/keybindings` to see the exact effective actions and keys for your build.
`/help`, `/hotkeys`, and the keybindings selector lead with concise human
labels and bound keys; machine action ids remain secondary for config JSON and
`/keybindings set` drafts and are the insertion authority when completing an
action argument. Human labels never replace that authority. Some actions
intentionally have no default key until a modal or feature makes them useful.
Defaults include `message_prev`=Alt+K, `message_next`=Alt+J, and
`jump_to_bottom`=Ctrl+End. Plain Up/Down remain transcript scroll only.
Alt+J/Alt+K can be rebound as editor aliases only by overriding `message_next` /
`message_prev`; until then those keys jump between transcript messages rather
than moving the composer cursor.

## Key names and conflict rules

Key names are case-insensitive and tolerate common punctuation differences.
Supported names include letters with modifiers, arrows, editing keys, function
keys, and special keys such as:

- `Enter`, `Shift+Enter`, `Ctrl+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`
- `Backspace`, `Ctrl+Backspace`, `Delete`, `Alt+Delete`, `Insert`, `Clear`
- `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Space`, `Ctrl+Space`, `Esc`
- `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Ctrl+Left`, `Alt+Right`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`,
  `Home`, `End`
- `Ctrl+A` through supported control letters, `Ctrl+0` through `Ctrl+9`,
  `Ctrl+/`, `Ctrl+]`, `Ctrl+-`
- `Alt+B`, `Alt+D`, `Alt+F`, `Alt+H`, `Alt+J`, `Alt+K`, `Alt+L`, `Alt+W`,
  `Alt+Y`; `Meta+...` is accepted as an `Alt+...` spelling
- `F1` through `F12`

Most configured keys can belong to only one action. AVA validates conflicts in
the user override file and reports the key plus both actions when a conflict is
unsafe. Modal-scoped actions can share keys with normal composer actions: for
example, `tui.select.confirm: "Space"` confirms a highlighted select-list item
without making Space submit normal composer text. Session selector, model
selector, and tree actions are scoped the same way. The semantic `Ctrl+C`
actions for clear/copy/interrupt may share a key by design.

When an override assigns a key to a non-scoped action, AVA removes that key from
other conflicting inherited actions. Unbound Space still inserts text normally;
unbound enhanced keys such as `Ctrl+Space`, `Ctrl+digit`, and `Ctrl+/` remain
inert unless the terminal reports them and a binding uses them.

## Safe writes and validation behavior

Display and keybinding commands validate before they commit a config change.
AVA writes the target through an owner-only temporary file in the same directory,
syncs it, and atomically renames it into place. Existing symlink or non-regular
targets are rejected. Parent directories are created as needed.

Additional keybinding safeguards:

- `keybinds.json` must be a JSON object.
- Import sources and existing edit targets must be regular files.
- Keybinding imports and editable existing files are capped at 256 KiB.
- `init`, `import`, `set`, and `reset` validate the candidate JSON before the
  target is changed, then load the written file again as a final check.
- `/keybindings validate` never changes active bindings.
- A bad hand edit does not replace the current runtime keybindings; fix the file
  and run `/reload keybindings` again.

The safe-write path protects the target file replacement, but it is not a
multi-user merge protocol. Avoid simultaneous manual edits while running
`/keybindings set`, `/keybindings reset`, or `/theme`.
