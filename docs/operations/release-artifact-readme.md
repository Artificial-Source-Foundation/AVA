# AVA Linux Host Artifact

This archive contains the AVA terminal executable for the Linux host on which it was built. It is a dynamically linked host artifact, not a portable Linux distribution package or evidence that an official release was published.

This README is the **offline documentation spine** for the artifact. All 32 packaged source documents (30 Markdown and 2 JSON) are indexed below; source-tree category indexes, plans, and history are intentionally not installed because their maintainer/evidence navigation depends on the repository checkout.

## Runtime requirements

The audited Linux x64 candidate requires an x86-64 CPU with BMI2, glibc providing `GLIBC_2.38`, libstdc++ providing `GLIBCXX_3.4.32`, C++ ABI `CXXABI_1.3.13`, `libncursesw.so.6`, `libtinfo.so.6`, a usable terminfo database, and `curl` on `PATH`. The first-publication target is Linux x64 only; only architectures with native exact-candidate evidence may publish. Python and CMake are packaging-only requirements and are not needed to run AVA.

The 2026-08-23 source matrix passed on Ubuntu 24.04.4 x64 with GCC 13.3 under BetaTest/Unix Makefiles and Release/Ninja. Clang 18 was environment-blocked; MSVC, Windows, macOS, AArch64, and multi-config release qualification were not established.

## Basic commands

From the extracted top-level directory:

```sh
bin/ava --version
bin/ava --help
bin/ava
bin/ava --print "Explain this checkout"
bin/ava --rpc
bin/ava --acp
```

AVA stores user configuration and state under the XDG paths documented in [`docs/core/configuration.md`](docs/core/configuration.md). Provider use may require separately configured credentials; no credentials, local configuration, sessions, or provider output are included in this archive.

The adjacent `LICENSE` applies to this artifact. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` contains direct-dependency notices and distinguishes bundled dependencies from host runtime libraries. `PROVENANCE.json` records binary/source/dependency/architecture evidence. `release_qualified:true` proves only the implemented static source/gitlink/license/version/native-architecture/dynamic-dependency/package gates; it does not prove full CTest, native CI, sanitizer/terminal evidence, exact-byte retention, or official publication. `release_qualified:false` is explicit static non-qualification. No value is itself a release claim.
