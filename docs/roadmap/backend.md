# AVA Backend Roadmap

This roadmap defines the backend work needed for AVA 1.0 to feel capable enough for serious daily coding work while keeping AVA's product constraints: native C++23, one binary, terminal first, explicit safety boundaries, and inspectable local files.

Frontend/TUI planning is Carlo-owned and intentionally not tracked here. Backend items should expose terminal-agnostic contracts for interactive and headless clients without planning UI layout, renderer, or modal work.
The measurable backend maturity acceptance criteria and staged hardening gates live in `docs/roadmap/backend-maturity-baseline.md`. The approved command-permission, background-job, diagnostics, compaction, and session-title usability decisions and their implementation status are recorded in `docs/roadmap/backend-usability.md`.

External systems are behavior references for backend power, not architectures to copy directly. AVA should borrow the capability shape, then implement it with narrow C++ modules and clear permission boundaries.

## 1.0 Backend Goal

AVA 1.0 should be a reliable local coding-agent backend that supports:

- Long-running interactive and headless sessions.
- Strong streaming agent events for TUI and automation clients.
- Durable sessions with compaction, usage records, export, and branching-ready structure.
- Provider abstraction with at least OpenAI plus one additional production-quality provider path.
- Provider/model metadata for context windows, cost, tool support, streaming, and reasoning controls.
- Safe, high-quality file/search/edit/shell tools with permission audit trails.
- Context management that prevents long sessions from failing because the window filled up.
- A stable local plugin foundation for tools, commands, prompt resources, event hooks, and MCP servers after core safety is stable.

## Approved Backend MVP Cut

The 1.0 backend MVP was approved on 2026-05-03 after comparing AVA against external reference behavior. The MVP cut keeps AVA focused on a safe local coding-agent backend rather than full product parity with any reference system.

Required for the MVP, as implemented and verified for the 1.0 release:

- Provider-native OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Kimi/Moonshot, and OpenAI-compatible provider paths with fake-provider contract tests and opt-in live smokes. OpenAI is implemented, Anthropic and Gemini are native and offline-hardened, and DeepSeek/Kimi/Moonshot/OpenRouter-compatible shims have deterministic contract coverage; live credentialed smokes remain release-validation work.
- Reasoning/thinking storage, runtime events, RPC controls, and frontend-visible deltas for providers that expose reasoning.
- Safe mid-session model switching that preserves compatible history and rejects incompatible switches before sending invalid provider requests.
- Hardened built-in tools, tool cancellation where safe, and a registry foundation shared by built-in, plugin, and MCP tools.
- Out-of-process plugins with manifest validation, explicit enablement, diagnostics, permission/audit identity, and fake plugin tests.
- MCP stdio host support for tool discovery/calls, diagnostics, permission/audit identity, and fake MCP server tests.
- Docs, samples, protocol notes, and verification commands that prove the backend is ready.

Explicitly post-MVP or current-develop follow-up work still on the product roadmap:

- Landed after the original 1.0 cut-line in current backend/RPC: persistent permission rules, session tree/fork/clone/labels/names/caller-supplied branch-summary APIs, full LSP symbols/definitions/references with bounded on-disk sync and one exact-global-opt-in installed-only `clangd` recipe, backend multimodal/image attachment replay/storage/provider serialization, configurable `task` subagents, the runtime-owned background job registry, and base prompt metadata.
- 1.1 candidates that remain active: unified settings and reload diagnostics, broader live-provider smoke automation, plugin core-service proxy expansion, frontend/TUI consumption of existing session-tree contracts, unsaved-buffer LSP sync, and attachment UX beyond the implemented RPC path/inline-upload input. The installed-only `clangd` integration remains the sole automatic LSP recipe; every other server requires explicit configuration. Provider-generated branch summaries and Anthropic interactive OAuth are deferred unless their product/API prerequisites become concrete; AVA keeps caller-supplied branch summaries, provider-generated compaction summaries, and API-key plus stored/env OAuth bearer support.
- 1.2+ candidates: HTTP/server daemon mode, plugin marketplace/package manager/remote install, extension UI bridge, advanced MCP HTTP/OAuth/subscriptions/sampling/elicitation/pagination/resources, public/default parallel ordinary tool execution beyond the current internal read/search opt-in, OS-level plugin/shell sandboxing, dynamic custom-provider registration, and broader chained multi-agent orchestration beyond the native `task` slice.
- Later research: in-process native plugin ABI only if AVA accepts the crash/memory/C++ ABI support burden.

The current backend-only 1.1 candidate product list lives in `docs/plans/capabilities-1.1.md`.

Reference-code rule: material under `docs/reference-code/` is for behavior comparison only. Its source code and architecture must not be copied into AVA.

Terminology note: this roadmap uses "1.0" and "backend MVP" for the same capability cut. "Post-MVP" means 1.1 and later. Historical 1.0 evidence below is not an artifact-qualification or publication claim. Strict packaging provides static source/gitlink/license/architecture/dependency gates only; the [current release ledger](../product/release-readiness.md) limits first publication to Linux x64 after exact-byte/native/support/publication blockers close.

## Reference: Backend Maturity Capabilities

The local reference material lives under `docs/reference-code/`. The most relevant capability areas are:

| Area | Useful Lessons |
| --- | --- |
| Agent runtime | Evented runtime, lifecycle events, steering/follow-up queues, abort propagation, sequential/parallel tool execution. |
| Providers | Provider registry, model capabilities, environment credential discovery, OAuth refresh, provider compatibility shims. |
| Sessions | Append-only JSONL with tree entries, migrations, session fork/clone/switch, compaction summaries. |
| RPC | AVA-specific JSONL v1 protocol, bidirectional commands/events, model/session controls, resolver replies, and prompt steering. It is not ACP; stable ACP v1 uses the separate `ava --acp` endpoint, while an AVA-RPC-specific extension UI bridge remains deferred. |
| Tools | Pluggable operations, read/write/edit/bash/grep/find/ls, streaming tool updates, output truncation, robust edit diffs. |
| Compaction | Automatic/manual compaction, cut-point selection, retained recent context, branch summaries. |
| Extensions | Event hooks, custom tools, commands, providers, UI requests, message interception. |
| Tests | Backend behavior is covered by focused protocol, session, compaction, concurrency, and agent-loop tests. |

## 1.0 Backend Baseline State

AVA's backend is a version `1.0.0` local coding-agent backend baseline, not a toy prototype. The implemented foundation includes:

- CLI/runtime orchestration in `src/ava/app/`, including TUI, print, and JSONL RPC entry points.
- OpenAI auth, model config, prompt config, provider profiles, and curl transport.
- OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, Gemini GenerateContent, DeepSeek/Kimi/Moonshot-compatible, and OpenRouter-compatible provider paths in `src/ava/provider/`.
- Sequential-by-default agent loop plus configurable task subagents, background job registry, and a backend-only default-off read/search parallel opt-in in `src/ava/agent/`.
- Built-in tools for read, write, edit, glob, grep, bash, apply_patch, question, skill, task, webfetch, websearch, and capability-gated LSP diagnostics.
- Build/plan permission policy, session grants, and permission audit entries in `src/ava/permissions/` and session records.
- Append-only JSONL sessions, resume/list/export/stats/validation, usage/cost accounting, model/reasoning entries, and compaction entries in `src/ava/session/`.
- Project/global `AGENTS.md`, prompt command, skill, and subagent loading in `src/ava/context/`, `src/ava/agent/`, and the unified command registry.
- Out-of-process plugin and stdio MCP foundations with bounded protocols, enablement, diagnostics, permission/audit identity, and sample/fake-server coverage.

The remaining gap is post-1.0 breadth and product depth: richer permission-rule UX/diagnostics, session tree workflow polish over the implemented backend/RPC fork/clone/tree/caller-supplied summary contracts, unified settings/reload, unsaved-buffer LSP sync and separately approved recipes beyond `clangd`, RPC upload/input flows for multimodal attachments, plugin core-service proxy expansion, advanced MCP, plugin marketplace flows, HTTP/server daemon mode, broader live-provider smoke automation, public/default parallel ordinary tool execution beyond the current internal read/search opt-in, and multi-agent orchestration beyond the native `task` subagent/background-job slice.

## Milestone Audit Summary

Explorer agents checked each roadmap phase against the current AVA code and external reference lessons on 2026-04-30. A Phase 1 closure audit on the same date verified the normal build, sanitizer build, whitespace check, and headless CLI basics.

The 0.33 backend maturity ledger later grew large enough that the version docs moved through the 0.60 platform catch-up, 0.65 provider-hardening line, bundled 0.70 reasoning/model closeout, 0.75 extension foundation, 0.80 extension API stabilization, 0.90 release-candidate evidence, and 1.0 release bump. Treat older "immediate next" wording as historical unless it is restated below; the runtime reports `1.0.0`.

- Phase 0 documentation reconciliation is closed for the known under-reported backend features: current docs now surface print/RPC mode, `AGENTS.md` loading, manual compaction entries, export, OAuth refresh, permission audit persistence, and atomic writes, while older version plans with superseded deferrals are marked historical.
- Phase 1 is implemented and verified for the current backend baseline. Keep edge-case coverage aligned as later event/protocol boundaries expand.
- Phase 2 is implemented and verified for the approved evented-runtime scope: versioned event envelopes, shared event bus routing for headless modes, incremental provider streaming, reasoning lifecycle events, RPC protocol versioning/session commands, active-run cancellation, permission/question resolver replies, and bounded `steer`/`follow_up` queues.
- Phase 3 core context/session work is implemented for the approved scope: provider-generated `/compact`, automatic compaction, one bounded context-overflow retry, provider usage/cost records, RPC stats, model/reasoning entries, additive session version checks, branching-ready `id`/`parent_id` validation, and the later-landed RPC fork/clone/tree/caller-supplied branch-summary APIs. Provider-generated branch summaries remain deferred to a future branch-navigation UX slice.
- Phase 4's core tool-quality slice is implemented and verified: centralized built-in tool metadata, `.gitignore`-aware search with a documented native subset, bounded spill files, streaming tool progress, edit/apply_patch diff previews with CRLF/BOM diagnostics, per-path mutation serialization, `webfetch` behind `network.fetch`, and an LSP diagnostics first slice. Final validation included live headless smokes for read/search/webfetch plus RPC permission/question reply smokes for write/edit/apply_patch/bash/question; LSP diagnostics are covered by fake-server tests because the tool is capability-gated. Remaining tool-quality expansion includes broader fuzzy/Unicode matching, image/multimodal reads, LSP symbols/definitions/references, and Phase 6-grade registry/artifact ownership.
- Phase 5 is implemented and verified for its foundation scope: provider registry, model capability catalog, provider-neutral credential discovery, retry/error normalization, Anthropic Messages support, model-change session entries, and RPC model listing/switching. Kimi-for-coding supplied the accepted additional production-quality provider evidence for 1.0; Anthropic, Moonshot, and OpenRouter-compatible live smokes remain provider-breadth follow-up because they were auth/credential-blocked.
- Phase 5.5 has moved past the first provider-native slice: provider-neutral content parts, Anthropic native `tool_use`/`tool_result`, Gemini GenerateContent request/response/SSE handling, thinking/signature/redacted-thinking, cache usage, stop reasons, Anthropic reasoning metadata and API-family validation, Kimi/Moonshot-compatible reasoning coverage, OpenRouter-compatible request/error coverage with built-in reasoning controls disabled, provider-switch compatibility checks, and retry/idempotency documentation are implemented for the 1.0 scope. Remaining risk is post-1.0 provider breadth: live credentialed endpoint smoke coverage, broader provider compatibility drift, OpenRouter-native reasoning support, and richer pricing/cache/strict-schema metadata.
- Phase 6 has a source-backed safe local plugin/MCP foundation: subprocess containment, command exposure, MCP stdio hosting, MCP prompt discovery/invocation, read-style MCP resource containment, plugin diagnostics, plugin prompt/skill resources and commands, unified command-registry seams, AI-friendly authoring docs, a checked-in sample plugin, real-sample headless RPC smoke coverage, compatibility policy, minimal golden contracts, focused audit rechecks, selected failure coverage, and OpenAI 5.5 manual headless release-validation coverage are implemented and tested. Broader diagnostics polish and plugin/MCP failure-matrix expansion remain post-1.0 hardening; non-OpenAI live provider smoke evidence remains credential-dependent follow-up validation.

## 1.0 Gap Inventory

This inventory started as pre-1.0 planning. Keep it as historical rationale plus post-1.0 follow-up context; `docs/product/backend-capabilities-1.0.md` is the current capability-status table for the 1.0 backend baseline.

### Runtime And Events

AVA now has the Phase 2 backend event model needed for headless clients and future UI integration.

Missing or incomplete:

- Interactive frontend consumption of the shared event stream is Carlo-owned; the backend event stream is implemented and replayable.
- Broader reasoning presentation polish beyond the provider-neutral reasoning lifecycle events already emitted for supported models.
- Deeper cancellation interruption inside buffered/non-streaming provider calls and individual long-running tools beyond the current cooperative boundaries.
- Public parallel tool execution controls beyond the current internal read/search opt-in, if the tool and permission model can safely support them.

1.0 target:

- Every run emits structured lifecycle events.
- TUI and RPC consume the same event stream.
- Cancellation is observed promptly at tool and shell boundaries and at safe provider boundaries. Direct interruption of in-flight provider transport calls remains a hardening item unless the transport boundary can support it safely.
- Tool execution remains sequential by default. Explicit public parallel eligibility is later work; current develop has only an internal read/search opt-in for preflight-proven builtin calls.

### Providers And Auth

AVA's provider layer now has a registry-backed OpenAI path, an Anthropic Messages path with native `tool_use`/`tool_result` and reasoning replay, a Gemini GenerateContent path with native request/response/SSE coverage, DeepSeek/Kimi/Moonshot-compatible shims with deterministic reasoning-content coverage, and an OpenRouter-compatible shim with deterministic request/error coverage but no built-in reasoning controls yet. OpenAI OAuth credentials refresh before use when a refresh token is available. External behavior references remain useful for live smoke coverage, model metadata, Kimi/Moonshot quirks, OpenRouter-native reasoning, and broader provider compatibility drift; AVA should match the relevant behavior without copying implementation architecture.

Missing or incomplete:

- Follow-up live provider-breadth smokes for Anthropic streaming/non-streaming paths, DeepSeek, Gemini, Moonshot, and OpenRouter-compatible paths. OpenAI and Kimi-for-coding already have 1.0 release evidence.
- Broader provider compatibility drift beyond the deterministic fake contracts currently covering Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, Moonshot, and OpenRouter-style routes, including OpenRouter-native reasoning fields.
- Moonshot coding behavior beyond the implemented compatible route, plus deeper reference-informed Kimi/Moonshot prompt/profile work and additional live endpoint validation.
- Provider-specific auth discovery beyond simple API-key/OAuth-token sources, such as Google ADC, AWS Bedrock credentials, or provider-specific CLI tokens.
- Provider-specific idempotency keys where providers support request ids or idempotency keys; current behavior is documented as best-effort without deduplication guarantees.

1.0 target:

- OpenAI remains excellent.
- At least one additional provider path reaches production-quality for 1.0; Kimi-for-coding is accepted for the 1.0 provider-breadth requirement, while Anthropic, Moonshot, and OpenRouter-compatible paths remain follow-up provider-breadth validation.
- Provider/model definitions declare capabilities that the runtime can enforce.
- OAuth credentials refresh before expiry.
- Provider failures are categorized and actionable.
- Provider-native protocols preserve tool/result/thinking semantics instead of relying on text-only transcript replay.
- Reasoning deltas are emitted in a shape that a frontend can display without parsing provider-specific raw events.

### Sessions And Context

AVA has append-only session storage, persisted permission audit entries, provider-generated compaction, automatic compaction, bounded context-overflow retry, usage/cost records, RPC stats, backend/RPC session tree inspection, fork, clone, labels, names, and caller-supplied branch summaries. Remaining work is UX maturity rather than storage shape.

Missing or incomplete:

- Richer frontend/TUI session-tree workflows and generated branch-summary UX beyond the backend/RPC slice.
- Full rewrite-style migrations for future schema changes beyond the current additive version checks and actionable future-version rejection.
- Broader live token/context accounting polish beyond the current session stats, provider usage records, model metadata, and frontend status/sidebar surfaces.

1.0 target:

- Long sessions can continue without manual transcript pruning.
- Session files remain inspectable JSONL.
- Session entries are versioned and migration-ready.
- Branching is either implemented or the storage format is ready for it without another rewrite.

### Tools And Operations

AVA has a strong small tool set with permissioned atomic file writes where practical, cooperative cancellation for read/write/edit file operations, tested shell process-group cleanup on timeout, Phase 4 search/edit/web/LSP improvements, and remaining maturity work around deeper abstractions and expanded code intelligence.

Missing or incomplete:

- Dedicated filesystem and process operation interfaces beneath tools.
- Broader Unicode normalization awareness and fuzzy edit fallback beyond current exact matching with CRLF/BOM diagnostics.
- UI-mediated patch preview/approval flow beyond provider-visible bounded unified diffs.
- Search parity for unsupported `.gitignore` edge syntax such as bracket character classes; current native matcher documents its subset.
- Broader process-tree cleanup proofs beyond the current bash timeout, plugin, MCP, and LSP process-group coverage.
- RPC/headless upload plumbing for image attachments; backend replay/storage/provider serialization for existing AVA-managed image attachments is implemented.
- LSP pull/publish diagnostics, document/workspace symbols, definitions, references, bounded full-text on-disk sync, explicit `lsp.json`, and one global exact-opt-in installed-only identity-bound `clangd` recipe are implemented. The installed-only `clangd` integration is the sole automatic LSP recipe; every other server requires explicit configuration. Remaining LSP maturity work is unsaved-buffer sync and UI/RPC presentation polish.
- Delete/move tools, only after audit and permissions are stronger.

1.0 target:

- Tools are safe, bounded, testable, and independently replaceable in tests.
- File writes are atomic where practical.
- Search is predictable for real repositories.
- Shell execution has strong timeout, cancellation, and output semantics.
- Tool results are useful to users, not only to the model.

### Permissions And Audit

AVA's permission model is a differentiator. Tool permission decisions are persisted as session audit entries,
headless RPC has an exact-match session grant path for repeated prompts with inspect, revoke, and clear
commands, and durable persistent allow/deny rules can be listed, added, removed, validated, and audited through RPC.

Missing or incomplete:

- Richer permission-rule management UX and broader policy categories beyond the implemented durable exact-match rule store.
- Broader session-wide grants and durable grant storage beyond the headless exact-match session-grant path.
- Deny reasons surfaced consistently to users and headless clients.
- Richer permission-prompt UX beyond the current TUI and RPC resolver flows.
- Richer audit views that connect request, decision, actor, and executed operation.
- Policy categories for delete/move, plugin tools, and external directories. `network.fetch` and `lsp.query` now exist for the Phase 4 web/LSP tools.

1.0 target:

- Every ask/allow/deny decision is auditable.
- Interactive and headless modes share the same permission semantics.
- Persistent rules are explicit, inspectable, and revocable.
- New tool classes cannot bypass policy.

### Headless And Automation

AVA has print mode and JSONL RPC protocol version 1. Print/RPC now share the event envelope for provider streaming, tool lifecycle/progress, permission requests, question requests, cancellation, queue lifecycle, retry countdown ticks, assistant messages, and terminal outcomes. Live headless smokes verified model-visible tool calls for read/search/webfetch in print mode and mutating/bash/question tools through RPC resolver replies.

Missing or incomplete:

- Extension UI bridge or an explicit narrower replacement for select/confirm/input/editor-style requests.
- Richer frontend/editor workflows around the implemented fork/clone/tree/branch-summary RPC commands.
- Direct backend command for bash and richer stable command schemas beyond the current compact/export/context/state commands.
- Broader subprocess-level protocol tests and live smoke automation that can exercise all resolver paths without ad hoc harness code.

1.0 target:

- AVA RPC v1 is stable for subprocess automation and test harnesses. Standards-based editor integration uses the separate stable `ava --acp` endpoint; client filesystem/terminal routing and official-SDK plus opt-in acpx interoperability are implemented independently without altering RPC v1. Zed 1.9.0 is manual verified for the captured confined lifecycle/tool/permission/client-filesystem/client-terminal and cancellation flows; JetBrains/CodeCompanion configuration is documented but was not executed here.
- Print mode stays simple and script-friendly.
- Server mode remains deferred until stdio RPC is proven.

### Extensibility And Plugin System

AVA should not jump straight into a marketplace-scale platform, but a serious 1.0 backend should include a small, stable plugin foundation. Users should be able to create a plugin with docs, examples, or AI assistance without writing C++, and a bad plugin should fail as a contained plugin failure instead of crashing or corrupting AVA's core state. The plugin/MCP contract is expanded in `docs/extensions/plugin-system.md`.

The safest 1.0 shape is an out-of-process plugin protocol: AVA launches a plugin executable, performs a versioned handshake, exchanges bounded JSONL messages, and routes plugin contributions through the same validation, permission, event, audit, cancellation, and session paths used by built-in features. AVA should avoid in-process native shared-library plugins for 1.0 because they can crash the process, corrupt memory, and create a C++ ABI support burden.

Implemented foundation:

- The registry and command seams accept built-in, plugin, project/global prompt, skill, and MCP prompt contributions behind bounded validation and permission paths.
- Plugin manifests, discovery, explicit enablement, versioned handshake, out-of-process runner lifecycle, startup/request timeouts, cancellation, stderr/stdout bounds, malformed-record handling, plugin command/tool/static-resource/event paths, and diagnostics are implemented and tested for the current foundation scope.
- AI-friendly authoring docs and a checked-in `examples/plugins/todo/` sample now exist, and focused tests load and run the actual sample files.
- MCP stdio startup, initialize, tool discovery/calls, read-style resource listing/reads, prompt discovery/get, command-registry prompt invocation, diagnostics, and fake-server coverage share bounded AVA paths.

Missing or incomplete:

- Broader plugin/MCP diagnostics and failure-matrix expansion beyond the current 1.0 containment coverage.
- Keep advanced MCP resource features deferred beyond the landed read-style resource slice: subscriptions, templates, binary/blob surfacing, remote transports, and broader diagnostics remain future work.
- Add the core service proxy for plugin-requested file/search/shell/network operations if plugin side effects must go through AVA policy rather than ad hoc plugin behavior.
- Keep native `task` subagent docs current after the post-1.0 implementation; plugin-contributed subagent packages and chained orchestration remain future work.

1.0 target:

- Core modules expose narrow extension seams.
- Built-in tools and plugin tools use the same registry, validation, permission, event, audit, and cancellation shape.
- A simple plugin can add a tool, slash command, prompt template, or non-mutating event hook without requiring C++ changes.
- Plugin process crashes, hangs, malformed JSONL, unsupported API versions, or invalid results produce contained plugin errors and do not kill AVA or corrupt session files.
- Plugin-contributed operations cannot bypass AVA permissions when they request file, shell, network, external-directory, or session access through AVA.
- MCP servers are launched or connected through explicit permissioned configuration; MCP tools, read-style resources, and prompts are exposed through bounded AVA registry paths; and advanced MCP resource behavior remains deferred unless it preserves explicit read-style permission boundaries.
- The v1 plugin API has an explicit compatibility policy, deprecation path, and contract tests.
- Native `task` subagents use child sessions, automatically allowed/audited launch, foreground nested Ask UI, fail-closed background nested Ask actions, and the background job registry; MCP stays bounded to the explicit 1.0 host scope in `docs/extensions/plugin-system.md`, and plugin-contributed subagent packages remain future work.
- Full untrusted-code sandboxing remains a separate hardening layer; arbitrary plugin executables must be treated as local code the user chose to run unless AVA later adds OS-level sandboxing.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 0: Roadmap Reconciliation

Purpose: make the planning base truthful before deeper work.

Scope:

- Update stale product/version docs that still describe print, RPC, AGENTS loading, manual compaction records, and export as deferred.
- Update stale docs that still describe OAuth refresh, permission audit persistence, and atomic file writes as future work.
- Keep `docs/rpc-protocol.md` as the normative RPC v1 client contract and `docs/headless-protocol.md` for shared headless behavior.
- Add an explicit 1.0 backend capability checklist to product planning.
- Make version docs clearly historical when they describe old deferred status.
- Cross-check `README.md`, `docs/core/configuration.md`, `docs/core/usage.md`, `docs/operations/testing.md`, `docs/headless-protocol.md`, and `docs/product/*.md` against current code before starting Phase 2.

Acceptance criteria:

- Docs agree on what is implemented, deferred, and required for 1.0.
- The backend roadmap is the source of truth for backend sequencing.
- `docs/product/backend-capabilities-1.0.md` exists and maps each 1.0 backend capability to current status and roadmap phase.
- Documented commands and protocol examples match app command/RPC handlers or are explicitly marked planned.
- `git --no-pager diff --check` passes after documentation reconciliation.

### Phase 1: Backend Hardening

Purpose: make the current backend reliable before expanding it.

Scope:

- Keep OpenAI OAuth refresh token exchange covered by tests and wired before provider startup fails on expiry.
- Keep permission decision entries persisted for every allow, ask, and deny resolution.
- Split or extend focused regression tests for permissions, file tools, search tools, bash, sessions, print mode, and RPC mode.
- Keep safe filesystem/process operation boundaries under existing tools and document any remaining seams that Phase 4 must extract.
- Keep `write_file` and `edit_file` atomic via temp-file plus rename; `apply_patch` already uses staged replacement.
- Keep bash cancellation and timeout cleanup covered by regression tests.
- Add `git --no-pager diff --check` and sanitizer runs to release verification docs.
- Verify permission audit export includes operation, path/command, decision, resolver source, and denial reason where applicable.
- Add or keep headless coverage for malformed input, cancellation, permission denial, and successful fake-provider prompt flow.

Acceptance criteria:

- Existing single-provider workflows are stable.
- Permission audit entries appear in session export.
- File writes do not leave obvious partial writes on normal failure paths.
- Headless tests cover malformed input, cancellation, permission denial, and successful prompt flow with a fake provider.
- Release verification docs include normal, sanitizer, and whitespace-check commands from `AGENTS.md`.

### Phase 2: Evented Runtime And Protocol

Status: implemented and verified for the approved Phase 2 scope on 2026-05-01. Deferred items that depend on a broader provider registry or richer model capability metadata are tracked under Phase 5.

Purpose: turn the backend into a shared runtime for TUI and automation clients.

Scope:

- Define a runtime event taxonomy for session, run, turn, message, provider, tool, permission, queue, compaction, retry, cancellation, and error events.
- Define a stable event envelope with schema version, event type, event id, session id, run id, turn id where applicable, timestamp, correlation ids, payload, and error fields.
- Include agent, turn, message start/update/end, thinking update, tool start/update/end, permission, queue, compaction, retry, retry countdown, cancellation, and error event types in that taxonomy.
- Add a subscription-style event bus that can feed TUI, print JSON, RPC, tests, and future plugins without each mode reading private loop state.
- Redesign the transport/provider boundary to support incremental stream event delivery instead of only returning a complete HTTP response.
- Route TUI, print JSON, and RPC through the same event stream.
- Add message delta events when provider streaming is available.
- Add thinking/reasoning delta events when provider capabilities expose them.
- Add async cancellation tied to active provider/tool runs, including a terminal cancellation event.
- Add RPC protocol versioning and a compatibility rule for unknown request/event fields.
- Add RPC `steer`, `follow_up`, `get_messages`, `get_session_stats`, `new_session`, and `switch_session` commands. Model selection commands such as `set_model`, `cycle_model`, and `get_available_models` are deferred to the Phase 5 provider/model catalog work.
- Add RPC question and permission resolver flows.
- Add subprocess-level RPC tests that feed JSONL requests and assert response/event order with fake provider transport.

Acceptance criteria:

- A client can observe a full turn without reading session internals.
- Message deltas, tool start/update/end, permission prompts, and final terminal events are visible over RPC.
- A client can cancel an active provider/tool run and receive a terminal event.
- The event envelope can add future compaction, retry, provider, and extension events without breaking existing clients.
- TUI behavior does not depend on private agent-loop state.
- RPC tests cover malformed JSONL, unknown commands, prompt success, permission/question resolver flows, cancellation, and session commands.

### Phase 3: Context, Usage, And Sessions

Purpose: support long-running real projects.

Status: implemented and verified for the approved core scope on 2026-05-01. Full fork/clone/tree APIs, branch summaries, and mid-session model/thinking entries are deferred to later phases.

Scope:

- Implemented provider-generated compaction summaries for `/compact` and automatic compaction.
- Implemented a structured compaction prompt that captures goal, constraints/preferences, decisions, files read/modified, unresolved tasks, and next steps.
- Wired automatic compaction into the agent loop using token estimates, configured model context windows, and a safe fallback threshold.
- Implemented one bounded context-overflow retry after compaction.
- Stored provider usage metadata and conservative cost metadata on assistant messages.
- Extracted OpenAI provider usage data when available and stored byte-estimate fallback metadata separately when it is not.
- Added session stats aggregation for RPC/UI consumers without requiring clients to parse JSONL.
- Added additive session version checks, future-version rejection, and branching-ready `id`/`parent_id` validation.
- Deferred full fork/clone/tree APIs, branch summaries, and mid-session model/thinking entries.
- Added RPC/session APIs for messages, stats, provider-backed compaction, export, and context inspection. Branch/tree APIs remain deferred until the backend session workflow slice starts.

Acceptance criteria:

- Long sessions compact automatically before they fail from context pressure.
- `/compact` produces useful provider summaries, not empty placeholders.
- Session exports show usage, cost, compaction, and permission audit information.
- Session stats are available to TUI and RPC without reparsing JSONL in clients.
- Context-overflow retry has a max retry count and cannot loop forever.
- Session files remain inspectable JSONL and old entries can be migrated or rejected with actionable errors.

### Phase 4: Tool Quality And Code Intelligence

Purpose: make AVA's tools feel dependable on real repositories.

Scope:

- Improve `edit_file` and `apply_patch` with unified diff previews, line-ending preservation, BOM handling, Unicode-normalization awareness, fuzzy fallback, and clearer failure messages.
- Add multi-edit support to `edit_file` if it remains distinct from `apply_patch`, with overlap detection and per-edit diagnostics.
- Add per-path mutation serialization for writes/edits/patches.
- Respect `.gitignore` by default, prune ignored directories before traversal, and support an explicit `no_ignore` option for search tools.
- Decide whether search is backed by `rg`, libgit2 ignore parsing, or a small internal ignore matcher, then document the portability tradeoff.
- Add tool output spill files for truncated shell/search output.
- Add streaming tool progress events.
- Add `webfetch` behind network permission policy with URL validation, content-type handling, size limits, timeout, and redirect policy.
- Add an LSP lifecycle manager, starting with diagnostics and then symbols, definitions, and references.
- Decide whether image reading belongs in core for multimodal support.
- Add tool registry metadata for name, description, input schema, output bounds, permission category, execution mode, and event rendering hints.

Acceptance criteria:

- Edits explain why they failed and show safe previews when they will change files.
- Search results match developer expectations in common repositories.
- Web and LSP tools are permissioned, bounded, and covered by tests.
- Truncated shell/search output points to bounded spill files when full output is useful.
- Concurrent mutations to the same path are serialized or rejected deterministically.
- Tool metadata is centralized enough for Phase 6 plugin and MCP tools to reuse the same registry shape.

### Phase 5: Provider And Model Breadth

Purpose: make AVA provider-flexible without weakening the core loop.

Scope:

- Introduce a provider registry with provider factories and no hard-coded provider selection in app modes.
- Expand model capability metadata to include API family, context window, max output tokens, input modalities, tool support, streaming support, reasoning support, usage support, pricing, cache pricing, and compatibility quirks.
- Add at least one non-OpenAI provider with streaming, tool calls, usage handling, and tests.
- Add model catalog fields for context window, max output, input modalities, cost, cache pricing, and provider compatibility quirks.
- Add environment credential discovery beyond OpenAI, with a documented resolution order for CLI/config/auth-file/env sources.
- Refactor OpenAI-shaped auth state only as far as needed for a second provider; do not broaden credential storage without tests.
- Normalize provider errors, including context overflow, auth, quota, invalid request, refusal/content filter, and transient transport failures.
- Add retry/backoff/rate-limit handling, including `Retry-After` parsing where available.
- Add reasoning/thinking controls only where provider capabilities support them.
- Add model-change and reasoning-control validation before a run starts and when RPC changes the active model.

Acceptance criteria:

- Provider selection is not hard-coded in app modes.
- Model capabilities are checked before enabling tools, streaming, reasoning, or context thresholds.
- Usage and cost are calculated from provider usage data and model pricing metadata.
- Provider failures produce actionable user-facing errors.
- Tests can register a fake provider through the registry without using OpenAI-specific code paths.
- A non-tool-capable model does not receive tool definitions.
- Auth discovery and refresh failures preserve existing credentials and produce safe, actionable errors.

### Phase 5.5: Provider-Native Hardening And Breadth

Status: 0.65 provider-native hardening is implemented for offline/fake coverage: provider-neutral `ContentPart` replay, Anthropic native `tool_use`/`tool_result`, Gemini GenerateContent contracts, thinking/signature/redacted-thinking, cache usage, stop reasons, Anthropic reasoning metadata and validation, DeepSeek/Kimi/Moonshot/OpenRouter-compatible shim contracts, provider-switch compatibility checks, and documented best-effort retry/idempotency behavior. Live credentialed smokes remain deferred provider-breadth evidence.

Purpose: turn Phase 5's provider-flexible foundation into provider-native behavior that is reliable across real Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible providers before plugin and MCP seams depend on it.

Scope:

- Extend the provider-native message/content contract beyond the completed text/tool-call/tool-result slice to represent images/files when supported, provider reasoning/thinking blocks, provider-specific stop reasons, and cache-control hints without flattening everything into plain text.
- Preserve existing session JSONL readability while adding enough structured replay metadata for providers that require native `tool_use`/`tool_result` or thinking-signature continuity. Native Anthropic replay and compatible `reasoning_content` replay are implemented for the current scope.
- Complete remaining Anthropic Messages release evidence after the offline-hardening pass: real endpoint smokes for streaming and non-streaming paths, plus ongoing public-doc rechecks for thinking/cache semantics.
- Keep Anthropic-compatible endpoint support explicit: configurable base URL, API-key auth, no credential leakage across redirects, tolerant but loud SSE parsing, and tests that cover common compatible-provider drift.
- Add more provider families or compatibility shims only with explicit protocol/auth/model metadata and smoke plans. OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as OpenRouter/DeepSeek/xAI/Groq/Mistral remain candidates where the Responses or Chat Completions shape is close enough; Google Gemini is now covered by native GenerateContent, while Bedrock/Vertex wait for credential-chain and event-stream plans.
- Add and maintain explicit Kimi/Moonshot coding capability profiles: Kimi-specific coding prompt selection, Kimi K2/K2.5/K2-thinking model aliases across Moonshot and compatible gateways, temperature/top-p defaults, endpoint-family thinking quirks, `reasoning_content` handling, and Moonshot/Kimi context-overflow patterns.
- Before implementation, re-check current external reference behavior and current public Kimi/Moonshot docs so AVA chooses the smallest correct provider path instead of guessing between OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible routes.
- Add provider-specific request transforms behind provider implementations, not in the agent loop: schema sanitization, tool-name quirks, strict JSON schema variants, stop-sequence fields, reasoning/thinking controls, max-output fields, and modality limits.
- Add provider-specific auth discovery only with safe documented precedence and tests. Environment variables are sufficient for first support, but stored auth files, OAuth refresh, ADC, AWS, and CLI-token discovery must be explicit per provider.
- Add provider-native fake transports/harnesses that exercise a complete tool loop for each non-OpenAI provider: request with tools, provider tool call, AVA tool result, follow-up request with native result block, and final answer.
- Harden retry/idempotency policy for provider POSTs. Current 0.65 behavior is documented as best-effort without provider-specific idempotency keys; add keys later where a provider supports deduplication.
- Update model catalog metadata with provider-native compatibility flags such as `api_family`, strict schema requirements, tool-result support, reasoning parameter names, thinking signature requirements, cache-control support, max image/file constraints, and known endpoint quirks.

Acceptance criteria:

- Anthropic can complete a multi-turn tool workflow using native `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks, not text-only summaries.
- Anthropic fake-transport/agent-loop tests cover streaming and non-streaming native workflows; real CLI/transport endpoint smokes remain deferred release evidence when credentials are unavailable.
- Switching from a tool-capable provider to a non-tool provider either prunes/translates tool history safely or produces a clear warning/error before an invalid request is sent.
- Reasoning/thinking controls are only exposed when the selected model declares support and the provider request builder actually serializes the corresponding native fields.
- Kimi/Moonshot coding models have cataloged capabilities and endpoint quirks for OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible routes, including tests for request parameters, reasoning/thinking output, overflow classification, and the Kimi-specific coding prompt/profile.
- At least two additional provider families or shims are registered, documented, and covered by fake-provider contract tests for request shape, streaming parse, usage parse, auth discovery, and normalized errors.
- Provider-specific compatibility code stays inside provider modules or narrow transform helpers; the agent loop remains provider-neutral.
- Retry behavior is documented per provider as idempotent, best-effort, or disabled for unsafe request classes.
- The headless RPC model catalog shows enough capability and compatibility metadata for clients to avoid offering unsupported tools, modalities, or reasoning controls.

### Phase 6: Stable Plugin Foundation

Status: required for the 1.0 backend MVP, sequenced after provider-native and tool-registry foundations so external contributions cannot depend on unstable contracts.

Purpose: open backend seams as a small, safe plugin system without turning AVA into a marketplace or letting plugins destabilize the core.

Scope:

- Move built-in tools behind a registry interface.
- Treat the registry and event bus as prerequisites; do not implement external plugin execution before built-in tools and events use those seams.
- Define the plugin manifest schema, discovery paths, enable/disable rules, API versioning, and compatibility policy.
- Implement an out-of-process JSONL plugin runner with handshake, capability negotiation, timeout, cancellation, stderr capture, bounded output, malformed-record handling, restart/disable behavior, and contract tests.
- Add plugin tool contributions through the same registry used by built-in tools.
- Add custom backend slash commands through the registry.
- Add prompt templates and structured skills under global/project config paths.
- Add non-mutating event hooks for provider request/response metadata, tool call/result metadata, session lifecycle, and command handling.
- Add extension-scoped permission categories.
- Add plugin and MCP audit fields for plugin id/version, contribution id/type, MCP server id, requested capability, decision, resolver source, and executed core operation.
- Add plugin diagnostics: list, inspect, enable, disable, validate manifest, and show last failure.
- Keep the AI-friendly plugin authoring docs and minimal sample plugin current as the v1 contract hardens.
- Add MCP server support as a plugin contribution type, starting with stdio transport, `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, bounded-paginated `resources/list`, text-only `resources/read`, `prompts/list`, and `prompts/get`; keep advanced resource features deferred unless they retain explicit read-style permission boundaries.
- Add MCP diagnostics and tests with a fake server for launch, initialize, list, call, errors, malformed records, timeout, cancellation, restart, and shutdown.
- Document and harden the permission/session/cancellation boundaries for the native `task` subagent worker that landed after the original 1.0 plugin/MCP phase; do not expand into chained orchestration or plugin-managed subagent packages in this phase.

Acceptance criteria:

- Built-in tools and plugin tools share validation, permission, event, and audit paths.
- Plugins cannot mutate files, run commands, or fetch network resources without policy coverage.
- Project plugin code does not execute until the user explicitly enables that plugin and can inspect its requested capabilities.
- Plugin crashes, hangs, malformed records, invalid schemas, and unsupported API versions are reported as plugin failures without crashing AVA or corrupting session JSONL.
- A fake plugin subprocess is covered by tests for registration, successful tool call, permission denial, timeout, cancellation, malformed output, and disable behavior.
- A fake MCP server is covered by tests for initialization, tool listing, tool calls, read-style resource listing/reads, prompt discovery/get, permission denial, timeout, cancellation, malformed output, and restart behavior.
- A developer or AI assistant can create a minimal plugin from the docs without reading AVA C++ internals.
- Native `task` subagent workers have documented session, permission, and cancellation constraints before they are treated as stable; broader task graph orchestration remains out of phase scope.
- Plugin enablement storage, MCP naming, restart backoff, stderr capture limits, and collision handling are documented before the runner is treated as stable.

## 1.0 Cut Line

Versioned path from the 0.60 platform catch-up into the 1.0 backend MVP baseline:

- 0.65: provider-native hardening for Anthropic, Kimi/Moonshot/OpenAI-compatible shims, provider-switch safety, retry/idempotency documentation, and offline contract validation; live provider smokes remain the main deferred release evidence.
- 0.70: bundled into the 0.65 pass as a bounded reasoning/model lifecycle closeout for protocol docs, focused tests, and export polish.
- 0.75: source-backed extension foundation alpha: plugin manifests, explicit enablement, JSONL handshake, extension-scoped permissions/audit, plugin commands and prompt/skill resources, and MCP tools/prompts through bounded registry paths.
- 0.80: extension API stabilization. Authoring docs, the sample plugin, real-sample headless RPC smoke coverage, compatibility policy, minimal golden tests, focused plugin/MCP failure containment coverage, audit rechecks, the then-current MCP resource deferral decision, and OpenAI 5.5 manual headless validation were implemented; read-style MCP resources later landed behind `mcp.resource.read`, and the remaining stabilization at that point was final diagnostics polish or review-driven failure-matrix closure discovered by 0.90.
- 0.90: v1 release-candidate completion. Freezes v1 compatibility, re-audits docs/capabilities, records release verification and live smokes, resolves or explicitly defers every required partial, and provides the release-bump evidence. OpenAI live evidence is current and Kimi-for-coding has passing live prompt evidence; Anthropic remains auth-blocked, while Moonshot/OpenRouter-compatible prompt evidence remains credential-blocked.
- 1.0: backend MVP runtime baseline at `1.0.0` after the required cut-line capabilities below were completed and verified.

Required for 1.0:

- OAuth refresh.
- Permission decision persistence and session audit export.
- Stable event stream shared by TUI, print JSON, and RPC.
- Async cancellation for provider and tool runs.
- Provider-generated manual and automatic compaction.
- Usage/cost/context accounting.
- Hardened file/search/bash tools with focused tests.
- Stable RPC protocol version with prompt, cancel, state, sessions, messages, compact, export, permission, and question flows.
- Provider registry with OpenAI plus one additional high-quality provider, backed by model capability and pricing metadata.
- Provider-native Anthropic support hardened through offline/fake coverage, plus Kimi/Moonshot and at least one OpenAI-compatible provider shim covered by fake-provider contract tests. OpenAI and Kimi-for-coding live prompt evidence now pass, and Kimi-for-coding is accepted as the additional production-quality provider path for 1.0. Anthropic is still blocked by configured-key authentication, and Moonshot/OpenRouter-compatible prompt evidence is blocked by missing auth for follow-up provider-breadth validation.
- Mid-session model switching, model-change session entries, and session stats exposed over RPC.
- Thinking/reasoning controls for providers and models that support them.
- Stable local plugin foundation with manifest schema, versioned out-of-process JSONL protocol, tool/command/prompt/event/MCP contributions, diagnostics, docs, and regression tests.

Strongly desired for 1.0:

- Session tree storage and fork/clone.
- LSP symbols, definitions, references, and richer code-intelligence UI beyond diagnostics.
- Image/file attachment reads for multimodal providers.
- Search parity for advanced `.gitignore` syntax beyond the documented native subset.
- Prompt templates and structured skills.
- Optional OS-level sandbox integration for plugin processes where it can be implemented without weakening portability.

Defer unless earlier phases finish cleanly:

- HTTP/server daemon mode.
- Plugin package manager, marketplace, or remote install flow.
- In-process native plugin ABI.
- Provider/message-interception plugins that can alter core prompts or provider requests before the event, permission, and audit model proves safe.
- MCP marketplace/discovery, complex remote MCP OAuth flows, and MCP sampling callbacks.
- Cross-platform hard sandbox guarantees for arbitrary untrusted plugin executables.
- Full theme/UI extension system.
- Broader built-in multi-agent orchestration beyond the current `task` subagent/background-job slice.

These deferred items remain product-roadmap items rather than discarded ideas. Track them as 1.1+ follow-up work after the backend MVP is stable and verified.

## Post-1.0 Status

The original Phase 5.5-only next-work marker has been overtaken by the 0.33/0.60 backend work, the 0.65/0.70 provider and reasoning closeout, the 0.75 extension foundation, the 0.80 stabilization/validation pass, the 0.90 release-candidate evidence, the 1.0 backend MVP baseline, and the July 2026 configurable task-subagent/background-job slice. Current status is:

- Run final commit/tag/release-publication steps only if explicitly requested.
- Keep Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini, Moonshot, and OpenRouter-compatible live smokes as follow-up provider-breadth validation unless the product decision changes.
- Start 1.1+ planning from the post-1.0 roadmap items instead of continuing to label the backend as 0.33, 0.60, or 0.90.
